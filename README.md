A fast C++ header-only library to help you quickly write parallel programs with complex task dependencies

# Why Cpp-Taskflow?

Cpp-Taskflow is by far faster, more expressive, and easier for drop-in integration
than existing parallel task programming libraries such as [OpenMP Tasking][OpenMP Tasking] and Intel [TBB FlowGraph][TBB FlowGraph].

![](image/performance.jpeg)

Cpp-Taskflow enables you to implement efficient task decomposition strategies
that incorporate both regular loop-based parallelism 
and irregular compute patterns to optimize the cpu performance.

See a quick [presentation][Presentation] and 
visit the [documentation][wiki] to learn more about Cpp-Taskflow.

# Get Started with Cpp-Taskflow

The following example [simple.cpp](./example/simple.cpp) shows the basic Cpp-Taskflow API
you need in most applications.

```cpp
#include <taskflow/taskflow.hpp>  // Cpp-Taskflow is header-only

int main(){
  
  tf::Taskflow tf;

  auto [A, B, C, D] = tf.silent_emplace(
    [] () { std::cout << "TaskA\n"; },               //  task dependency graph
    [] () { std::cout << "TaskB\n"; },               // 
    [] () { std::cout << "TaskC\n"; },               //          +---+          
    [] () { std::cout << "TaskD\n"; }                //    +---->| B |-----+   
  );                                                 //    |     +---+     |
                                                     //  +---+           +-v-+ 
  A.precede(B);  // A runs before B                  //  | A |           | D | 
  A.precede(C);  // A runs before C                  //  +---+           +-^-+ 
  B.precede(D);  // B runs before D                  //    |     +---+     |    
  C.precede(D);  // C runs before D                  //    +---->| C |-----+    
                                                     //          +---+          
  tf.wait_for_all();  // block until finish

  return 0;
}
```

Compile and run the code with the following commands:

```bash
~$ g++ simple.cpp -std=c++1z -O2 -lpthread -o simple
~$ ./simple
TaskA
TaskC  <-- concurrent with TaskB
TaskB  <-- concurrent with TaskC
TaskD
```

It is clear now Cpp-Taskflow is powerful in parallelizing tasks with complex dependencies.
The following example demonstrates a concurrent execution of 10 tasks with 15 dependencies.
With Cpp-Taskflow, you only need ***15 lines of code***.

<img align="right" src="image/complex.png" width="30%">

```cpp
// source dependencies
S.precede(a0);    // S runs before a0
S.precede(b0);    // S runs before b0
S.precede(a1);    // S runs before a1

// a_ -> others
a0.precede(a1);   // a0 runs before a1
a0.precede(b2);   // a0 runs before b2
a1.precede(a2);   // a1 runs before a2
a1.precede(b3);   // a1 runs before b3
a2.precede(a3);   // a2 runs before a3

// b_ -> others
b0.precede(b1);   // b0 runs before b1
b1.precede(b2);   // b1 runs before b2
b2.precede(b3);   // b2 runs before b3
b2.precede(a3);   // b2 runs before a3

// target dependencies
a3.precede(T);    // a3 runs before T
b1.precede(T);    // b1 runs before T
b3.precede(T);    // b3 runs before T
```

# Create a Taskflow Graph

Cpp-Taskflow has very expressive and neat methods to create dependency graphs.
Most applications are developed through the following three steps.

## Step 1: Create a Task

A task is a callable object for which [std::invoke][std::invoke] is applicable.
Create a taskflow object to start a task dependency graph.

```cpp
tf::Taskflow tf;
```


Create a task from a callable object via the method `emplace` and 
get a pair of a task handle and a [std::future][std::future] object.

```cpp
auto [A, F] = tf.emplace([](){ std::cout << "Task A\n"; return 1; });
```

If you don't need to access the returned result, use the method `silent_emplace` instead.

```cpp
auto A = tf.silent_emplace([](){ std::cout << "Task A\n"; });
```

Both methods can take arbitrary numbers of callables to create multiple tasks at one time.

```cpp
auto [A, B, C, D] = tf.silent_emplace(
  [] () { std::cout << "Task A\n"; },
  [] () { std::cout << "Task B\n"; },
  [] () { std::cout << "Task C\n"; },
  [] () { std::cout << "Task D\n"; }
);
```

## Step 2: Define Task Dependencies

Once tasks are created in the pool, you need to specify task dependencies in a 
[Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph) fashion.
The handle `Task` supports different methods for you to describe task dependencies.

**Precede**: Adding a preceding link forces one task to run ahead of one another.
```cpp
A.precede(B);  // A runs before B.
```

**Broadcast**: Adding a broadcast link forces one task to run ahead of other(s).
```cpp
A.broadcast(B, C, D);  // A runs before B, C, and D.
```

**Gather**: Adding a gathering link forces one task to run after other(s).
```cpp
A.gather(B, C, D);  // A runs after B, C, and D.
```

**Linearize**: Linearizing a task sequence adds a  preceding link to each adjacent pair.

```cpp
tf.linearize(A, B, C, D);  // A runs before B, B runs before C, and C runs before D.
```

## Step 3: Execute the Tasks

There are three methods to execute a task dependency graph, 
`dispatch`, `silent_dispatch`, and `wait_for_all`.

```cpp
auto future = tf.dispatch();  // non-blocking, returns with a future immediately.
tf.silent_dispatch();         // non-blocking, no return
```

Calling `wait_for_all` will block until all tasks complete.

```cpp
tf.wait_for_all();
```

Each of these methods dispatches the current graph to threads for execution
and create a data structure called *topology* to store the execution status.


# Dynamic Tasking

Another powerful feature of Taskflow is *dynamic* tasking.
A dynamic task is created during the execution of a dispatched taskflow graph, i.e.,
topology.
These tasks are spawned by a parent task and are grouped together to a *subflow* graph.
The example below demonstrates how to create a subflow
that spawns three tasks during its execution.

<img align="right" src="image/subflow_join.png" width="40%">

```cpp
// create three regular tasks
auto A = tf.silent_emplace([](){}).name("A");
auto C = tf.silent_emplace([](){}).name("C");
auto D = tf.silent_emplace([](){}).name("D");

// create a subflow graph (dynamic tasking)
auto B = tf.silent_emplace([] (auto& subflow) {
  auto B1 = subflow.silent_emplace([](){}).name("B1");
  auto B2 = subflow.silent_emplace([](){}).name("B2");
  auto B3 = subflow.silent_emplace([](){}).name("B3");
  B1.precede(B3);
  B2.precede(B3);
}).name("B");
            
A.precede(B);  // B runs after A 
A.precede(C);  // C runs after A 
B.precede(D);  // D runs after B 
C.precede(D);  // D runs after C 

// execute the graph without cleanning up topologies
tf.dispatch().get();
std::cout << tf.dump_topologies();
```

By default, a subflow graph joins to its parent node. 
This guarantees a subflow graph to finish before the successors of 
its parent node.
You can disable this feature by calling `subflow.detach()`.
Detaching the above subflow will result in the following execution flow.

<img align="right" src="image/subflow_detach.png" width="65%">

```cpp
// detach a subflow graph
[] (auto& subflow) {
  ...
  B1.precede(B3);
  B2.precede(B3);

  // detach from B 
  subflow.detach();
}).name("TaskB");
```

## Step 1: Create a Subflow

Cpp-Taskflow has an unified interface for static and dynamic tasking.
To create a subflow for dynamic tasking, 
emplace a callable on one argument of type `tf::SubflowBuilder`.

```cpp
auto A = tf.silent_emplace([] (tf::SubflowBuilder& subflow) {});
```

Similarly, you can get a [std::future][std::future] object to the execution status of the subflow.

```cpp
auto [A, fu] = tf.emplace([] (tf::SubflowBuilder& subflow) {});
```

A subflow builder is a lightweight object that allows you to create 
arbitrary dependency graphs on the fly.
All graph building methods defined in taskflow
can be used in a subflow builder.

```cpp
auto A = tf.silent_emplace([] (tf::SubflowBuilder& subflow) {
  std::cout << "Task A is spawning two subtasks A1 and A2" << '\n';
  auto [A1, A2] = subflow.silent_emplace(
    [] () { std::cout << "subtask A1" << '\n'; },
    [] () { std::cout << "subtask A2" << '\n'; }
    A1.precede(A2);
  );
});
```

A subflow can also be nested or recursive. You can create another subflow from
the execution of a subflow and so on.

<img align="right" src="image/nested_subflow.png" width="45%">

```cpp
auto A = tf.silent_emplace([] (auto& sbf){
  std::cout << "A spawns A1 & subflow A2\n";
  auto A1 = sbf.silent_emplace([] () { 
    std::cout << "subtask A1\n"; 
  }).name("A1");

  auto A2 = sbf.silent_emplace([] (auto& sbf2){
    std::cout << "A2 spawns A2_1 & A2_2\n";
    auto A2_1 = sbf2.silent_emplace([] () { 
      std::cout << "subtask A2_1\n"; 
    }).name("A2_1");
    auto A2_2 = sbf2.silent_emplace([] () { 
      std::cout << "subtask A2_2\n"; 
    }).name("A2_2");
    A2_1.precede(A2_2);
  }).name("A2");
  A1.precede(A2);
}).name("A");
```

## Step 2: Detach or Join a Subflow

A subflow has no methods to dispatch its tasks.
Instead, a subflow will be executed after leaving the context of the callable.
By default, a subflow joins to its parent task.
Depending on applications, you can detach a subflow to enable more parallelism.

```cpp
auto A = tf.silent_emplace([] (tf::SubflowBuilder& subflow) {
  subflow.detach();  // detach this subflow from its parent task A
});  // subflow starts to run after the callable scope
```

Detaching or Joining a subflow has different meaning in the ready status of 
the future object referred to it.
In a joined subflow, 
the completion of its parent node is defined as when all tasks
inside the subflow (possibly nested) finish.

<img align="right" src="image/joined_subflow_future.png" width="40%">

```cpp
int value {0};

// create a joined subflow
auto [A, fuA] = tf.emplace([&] (auto& subflow) {
  subflow.silent_emplace([&]() { 
    value = 10; 
  });
  return 100;   // some arbitrary value
});

// create a task B after A
auto B = tf.silent_emplace([&] () { 
  assert(value == 10); 
  assert(fuA.wait_for(0s) == std::future_status::ready);
});

// A1 must finish before A and therefore before B
A.precede(B);
```

When a subflow is detached from its parent task, it becomes a parallel
execution line to the current flow graph and will eventually
join to the same topology.

<img align="right" src="image/detached_subflow_future.png" width="40%">

```cpp
int value {0};

// create a detached subflow
auto [A, fuA] = tf.emplace([&] (auto& subflow) {
  subflow.silent_emplace([&]() { value = 10; });
  subflow.detach();
  return 100;   // some arbitrary value
});

// create a task B after A
auto B = tf.silent_emplace([&] () { 
  // no guarantee for value to be 10 nor fuA ready
});
A.precede(B);
```


# Debug a Taskflow Graph

Concurrent programs are notoriously difficult to debug.
Cpp-Taskflow leverages the graph properties to relieve the debugging pain.
To debug a taskflow graph,
(1) name tasks and dump the graph, and
(2) start with one thread before going multiple.
Currently, Cpp-Taskflow supports [GraphViz][GraphViz] format.

## Dump the Present Taskflow Graph

Each time you create a task or add a dependency, 
it adds a node or an edge to the present taskflow graph.
The graph is not dispatched yet and you can dump it to a GraphViz format.

```cpp
// debug.cpp
tf::Taskflow tf(0);  // use only the master thread
auto A = tf.silent_emplace([] () {}).name("A");
auto B = tf.silent_emplace([] () {}).name("B");
auto C = tf.silent_emplace([] () {}).name("C");
auto D = tf.silent_emplace([] () {}).name("D");
auto E = tf.silent_emplace([] () {}).name("E");

A.broadcast(B, C, E); 
C.precede(D);
B.broadcast(D, E); 

std::cout << tf.dump();
```

Run the program and inspect whether dependencies are expressed in the right way. 
There are a number of free [GraphViz tools][AwesomeGraphViz] you could find online
to visualize your Taskflow graph.

<img align="right" src="image/graphviz.png" width="25%">

```bash
~$ ./debug

// Taskflow with five tasks and six dependencies
digraph Taskflow {
  "A" -> "B"
  "A" -> "C"
  "A" -> "E"
  "B" -> "D"
  "B" -> "E"
  "C" -> "D"
}
```

## Dump the Dispatched Graphs

When you have dynamic tasks (subflows),
you cannot simply use the `dump` method because it displays only the static portion.
Instead, you need to execute the graph first to include dynamic tasks
and then use the `dump_topologies` method.

<img align="right" src="image/debug_subflow.png" width="40%">

```cpp
tf::Taskflow tf(0);  // use only the master thread

auto A = tf.silent_emplace([](){}).name("A");

// create a subflow of two tasks B1->B2
auto B = tf.silent_emplace([] (auto& subflow) {
  auto B1 = subflow.silent_emplace([](){}).name("B1");
  auto B2 = subflow.silent_emplace([](){}).name("B2");
  B1.precede(B2);
}).name("B");

A.precede(B);

// dispatch the graph without cleanning up topologies
tf.dispatch().get();

// dump the entire graph (including dynamic tasks)
std::cout << tf.dump_topologies();
```

# API Reference

| dump_topologies | none        | string | dump dispatched topologies to a string of GraphViz format |

### *emplace/silent_emplace/placeholder*

The main different between `emplace` and `silent_emplace` is the return value.
The method `emplace` gives you a [std::future][std::future] object to retrieve the result of the callable 
when the task completes.

```cpp
// create a task through emplace
auto [task, future] = tf.emplace([](){ return 1; });
tf.wait_for_all();
assert(future.get() == 1);
```

If you don't care the return result, using `silent_emplace` to create a task can give you slightly better performance.
```cpp
// create a task through silent_emplace
auto task = tf.emplace([](){ return; });
tf.wait_for_all();
```

When task cannot be determined beforehand, you can create a placeholder and assign the calalble later.
```cpp
// create a placeholder and use it to build dependency
auto A = tf.silent_emplace([](){});
auto B = tf.placeholder();
A.precede(B);

// assign the callable later in the control flow
B.work([](){ /* do something */ });
```

### *linearize*

The method `linearize` lets you add a linear dependency between each adjacent pair of a task sequence.

<img align="right" width="40%" src="image/linearize.png">

```cpp
// linearize five tasks
tf.linearize(A, B, C, D);
```

### *parallel_for*

The method `parallel_for` creates a subgraph that applies the callable to each item in the given range of
a container.

<img align="right" width="40%" src="image/parallel_for.png">

```cpp
// apply callable to each container item in parallel
auto v = {'A', 'B', 'C', 'D'};
auto [S, T] = tf.parallel_for(
  v.begin(),    // beg of range
  v.end(),      // end of range
  [] (int i) { 
    std::cout << "parallel in " << i << '\n';
  }
);
// add dependencies via S and T.
```

Changing the group size can force intra-group tasks to run sequentially
and inter-group tasks to run in parallel.
Depending on applications, different group sizes can result in significant performance hit.

<img align="right" width="20%" src="image/parallel_for_2.png">

```cpp
// apply callable to two container items at a time in parallel
auto v = {'A', 'B', 'C', 'D'};
auto [S, T] = tf.parallel_for(
  v.begin(),    // beg of range
  v.end(),      // end of range
  [] (int i) { 
    std::cout << "AB and CD run in parallel" << '\n';
  },
  2  // group to execute two tasks at a time
);
```

By default, taskflow performs an even partition over worker threads
if the group size is not specified.

### *reduce/transform_reduce*

The method `reduce` creates a subgraph that applies a binary operator to a range of items.
The result will be stored in the referenced `res` object passed to the method. 
It is your responsibility to assign it a correct initial value to reduce.

<img align="right" width="45%" src="image/reduce.png">

```cpp
auto v = {1, 2, 3, 4}; 
int sum {0};
auto [S, T] = tf.reduce(    // for example, 2 threads
  v.begin(), v.end(), sum, std::plus<int>()
);  
```

The method `transform_reduce` is similar to reduce, except it applies a unary operator before reduction.
This is particular useful when you need additional data processing to reduce a range of elements.

```cpp
std::vector<std::pari<int, int>> v = { {1, 5}, {6, 4}, {-6, 4} };
int min = std::numeric_limits<int>::max();
auto [S, T] = tf.transform_reduce(v.begin(), v.end(), min, 
  [] (int l, int r) { return std::min(l, r); },
  [] (const std::pair<int, int>& pair) { return std::min(p.first, p.second); }
);
```

By default, all reduce methods distribute the workload evenly across threads.

### *dispatch/silent_dispatch/wait_for_topologies/wait_for_all*

Dispatching a taskflow graph will schedule threads to execute the current graph and return immediately.
The method `dispatch` gives you a [std::future][std::future] object to probe the execution progress while
`silent_dispatch` doesn't.

```cpp
auto future = tf.dispatch();
// do something else to overlap with the execution 
// ...
std::cout << "now I need to block on completion" << '\n';
future.get();
std::cout << "all tasks complete" << '\n';
```

If you need to block your program flow until all tasks finish 
(including the present taskflow graph), use `wait_for_all` instead.

```cpp
tf.wait_for_all();
std::cout << "all tasks complete" << '\n';
```

If you only need to block your program flow until all dispatched taskflow graphs finish,
use `wait_for_topologies`.

```cpp
tf.wait_for_topologies();
std::cout << "all topologies complete" << '\n';
```

## Task API

Each time you create a task, the taskflow object adds a node to the present task dependency graph
and return a *task handle* to you.
A task handle is a lightweight object that defines a set of methods for users to
access and modify the attributes of the associated task.
The table below summarizes the list of commonly used methods.
Visit [documentation][wiki] to see the complete list.

| Method         | Argument    | Return | Description |
| -------------- | ----------- | ------ | ----------- |
| name           | string      | self   | assign a human-readable name to the task |
| work           | callable    | self   | assign a work of a callable object to the task |
| precede        | task        | self   | enable this task to run *before* the given task |
| broadcast      | task list   | self   | enable this task to run *before* the given tasks |
| gather         | task list   | self   | enable this task to run *after* the given tasks |
| num_dependents | none        | size   | return the number of dependents (inputs) of this task |
| num_successors | none        | size   | return the number of successors (outputs) of this task |

### *name*

The method `name` lets you assign a human-readable string to a task.

```cpp
A.name("my name is A");
```

### *work*

The method `work` lets you assign a callable to a task.

```cpp
A.work([] () { std::cout << "hello world!"; });
```

### *precede*

The method `precede` is the basic building block to add a precedence between two tasks.

<img align="right" width="20%" src="image/precede.png">

```cpp
// make A runs before B
A.precede(B);
```

### *broadcast*

The method `broadcast` lets you precede a task to multiple tasks.

<img align="right" width="30%" src="image/broadcast.png">

```cpp
// make A run before B, C, D, and E
// B, C, D, and E run in parallel
A.broadcast(B, C, D, E);
```

### *gather*

The method `gather` lets you add multiple precedences to a task.

<img align="right" width="30%" src="image/gather.png">

```cpp
// B, C, D, and E run in parallel
// A runs after B, C, D, and E complete
A.gather(B, C, D, E);
```

# Caveats

While Cpp-Taskflow enables the expression of very complex task dependency graph that might contain 
thousands of task nodes and links, there are a few amateur pitfalls and mistakes to be aware of.

+ Having a cycle in a graph may result in running forever
+ Trying to modify a dispatched task can result in undefined behavior
+ Touching a taskflow from multiple threads are not safe

Cpp-Taskflow is known to work on Linux distributions, MAC OSX, and Microsoft Visual Studio.
Please [let me know][email me] if you found any issues in a particular platform.

# System Requirements

To use Cpp-Taskflow, you only need a [C++17][C++17] compiler:
+ GNU C++ Compiler v7.3 with -std=c++1z
+ Clang C++ Compiler v6.0 with -std=c++17
+ Microsoft Visual Studio Version 15.7 (MSVC++ 19.14)

# Compile Unit Tests and Examples

Cpp-Taskflow uses [CMake](https://cmake.org/) to build examples and unit tests.
We recommend using out-of-source build.

```bash
~$ cmake --version  # must be at least 3.9 or higher
~$ mkdir build
~$ cd build
~$ cmake ../
~$ make 
```

## Unit Tests

Cpp-Taskflow uses [Doctest](https://github.com/onqtam/doctest) for unit tests.

```bash
~$ ./unittest/taskflow
```

Alternatively, you can use CMake's testing framework to run the unittest.

```bash
~$ cd build
~$ make test
```

## Examples

The folder `example/` contains several examples and is a great place to learn to use Cpp-Taskflow.

| Example |  Description |
| ------- |  ----------- | 
| [simple.cpp](./example/simple.cpp) | uses basic task building blocks to create a trivial taskflow  graph |
| [debug.cpp](./example/debug.cpp)| inspects a taskflow through the dump method |
| [emplace.cpp](./example/emplace.cpp)| demonstrates the difference between the emplace method and the silent_emplace method |
| [matrix.cpp](./example/matrix.cpp) | creates two set of matrices and multiply each individually in parallel |
| [dispatch.cpp](./example/dispatch.cpp) | demonstrates how to dispatch a task dependency graph and assign a callback to execute |
| [multiple_dispatch.cpp](./example/multiple_dispatch.cpp) | illustrates dispatching multiple taskflow graphs as independent batches (which all run on the same threadpool) |
| [parallel_for.cpp](./example/parallel_for.cpp)| parallelizes a for loop with unbalanced workload |
| [reduce.cpp](./example/reduce.cpp)| performs reduce operations over linear containers |
| [subflow.cpp](./example/subflow.cpp)| demonstrates how to create a subflow graph that spawns three dynamic tasks |
| [threadpool.cpp](./example/threadpool.cpp)| benchmarks different threadpool implementations |
| [threadpool_cxx14.cpp](./example/threadpool_cxx14.cpp)| shows use of the C++14-compatible threadpool implementation, which may be used when you have no inter-task (taskflow) dependencies to express |
| [taskflow.cpp](./example/taskflow.cpp)| benchmarks taskflow on different task dependency graphs |
| [executor.cpp](./example/executor.cpp)| shows how to create multiple taskflow objects sharing one executor to avoid the thread over-subscription problem |
